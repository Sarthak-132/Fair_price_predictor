# Fair_price_predictor :

# OVERVIEW : 
  This project is based on machine learning where we used linear regression algorithm for predicting the actual amount of the cars 
  on their past usability what will be their actual amount based on properties of cars what are their conditions how they work so 
  algorithm trained to predict atleast with 90% of accuracy.
  
# Technology : The whole project distributed in 3 parts -
  1. Front End - Front end development has done using HTML5 , CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT where all the website designed in optimized way 
  2. Back End -  In Back end we used flask the framework of python for web development used for backend . It is user friendly and 
                 use less code to manage the website also not that complex to maintain the website.
  3. Machine Learning - first we cleaned the data , impurities cleaned and fetched the cleaned.csv then we trained the data using 
     python language and trained it to predict right amount of the cars on their given properties 
     
# Merging : 
  After all the things are done backend connected to front data add app.py with backend and the machine cleaned data of 
  car and run the code afterward fill all the given properties of car it gives fair price of the car.
